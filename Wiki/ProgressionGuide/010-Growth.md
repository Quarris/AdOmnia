# 01 - Sneak Growth

Sneak growth is the concept that allows you to apply a bonemeal affect to the surrounding block by repeatedly sneaking around the area.

This can be used on anything that you can use bonemeal on, such as saplings or crops, but most importantly in the begging it will allow you to grow grass on the grass block that you spawn on.

Breaking grass will have a chance to drop tree seeds, which you can then plant and grow a tree using the same method.

P.S. You might want to get a surplus of seeds from the grass before growing the tree, as the grass block **WILL** disappear after the tree grows.
