# Crooks and Worms

Craft yourself a crook with the newly obtained wood.

Crooks can be used to increase your chances of getting saplings from trees, as well as can get your silk worms.

Worms are used to infest various blocks to turn them into other resources;
Silk worms will be able to convert your tree leaves into infested leaves, which when broken with a crook will yield you string.
